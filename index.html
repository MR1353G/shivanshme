        <section id="introduction">
            <p>Hey there! If you’re reading this, you’ve stumbled into the charming world of my not-so-secret crush on you. Grab a snack—this might be a bumpy ride!</p>

        <section id="traits">
            <h2>Why You’re Amazing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You’re smarter than a calculator (and way more fun!).</li>
                <li>Your smile could outshine the sun—no sunscreen needed!</li>
                <li>You have the patience of a saint (especially with my jokes)!</li>

            <h2>My (Totally Realistic) Proposal</h2>
            <p>Here goes nothing!</p>
            <p>Would you consider going on a date with me? (Disclaimer: This may involve awkward silences, cheesy jokes, and possibly ice cream.)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="odds">
            <h2>The Odds</h2>
            <p>According to my highly scientific calculations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 in 5 chance you’ll laugh.</li>
                <li>1 in 10 chance you’ll cringe.</li>
                <li>99% chance you’ll say ‘no’… but that’s okay!</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="rejection">
            <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
            <p>If you kindly decline, I promise to respect your decision and remain the same awesome (but slightly embarrassed) friend you know! No hard feelings, just good vibes and more bad jokes!</p>

    <footer>
        <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this! If nothing else, I hope it made you smile (or at least cringe). Can’t wait to hear from you, even if it’s just a ‘no!’</p>
